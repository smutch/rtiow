An attempt to learn more complicated Rust topics by building a ray tracer
following [_Ray Tracing in One
Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

**Warning**: Some parts of the code are deliberately over-complicated / poor
design. This is because I wanted to learn things like how to clone a vector of
boxed traits or what the pros-and-cons of traits vs. an enum of structs for
shared behaviour is.
